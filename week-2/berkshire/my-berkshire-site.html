<!--
	What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

		The HMTL itself is fairly straight forward in this case because the site is so simple.  We did not include any META tags, tables, or divs since there didn't seem to be a need. 

	How was it researching and using semantic HMTL5 elements?

		I keep wondering if we did the right things with regard to semantics, but I am hoping to learn from this experience and the feedback we recieve.  I will admit to being a little fuzzy about best practices for semantics, but I continue to do research.

	How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. not formatting in the HMTL)?

		We did add a style attribute to the img tag, but otherwise we left formatting alone and let the HTML chips fall where they may.  In the end our site looked like the example we saw on Canvas.

	What seems good and bad about HMTL?

		HTML is very basic seeming at this point, although I am aware that there is a great deal of complexity possible.  I don't know that I can place a value judgement on "good" or "bad" elements at this point.  It is not meant to handle formatting, but rather semantic structure.

	What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HMTL?

		Whenever I start a tag that needs to be closed, I immediately also add the closing tag so as to avoid a situation where I do a bunch of writing and then forget to wrap the node up.
