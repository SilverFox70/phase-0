 // Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself, with: ]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.
var adam = {};
adam.name = "Adam";
terah.spouse = adam;
terah.weight = 125;
delete terah.eyeColor;
adam.spouse = terah;
terah.children = {};
var carson = {};
terah.children.carson = carson;
carson.name = "Carson";
var carter = {};
terah.children.carter = carter;
carter.name = "Carter";
var colton = {};
terah.children.colton = colton;
colton.name = "Colton";
adam.children = terah.children;

// __________________________________________
// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines
// What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?

//    It took me a minute to figure out how to properly add carson as one of terah's children.
//    I thought at first I should assign terah.children = carson, but that is not correct. Line
//    26 does it correctly.

// How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?

//    It is very easy, in fact scarily easy to modify or delete an object in JS.  That is something
//    I feel we will have to be careful to watch out for.

// What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?

//    I learned that changing or modifying an object is very easy to do in JS, and that this could
//    likely lead to issues if you're not careful with your code.
