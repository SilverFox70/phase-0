#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Let's assume that you have already signed into github and now you want to create your very own repository, or repo.  If you look along the right hand side of the top menu bar you'll notice a "+" right next to your profile picture.  Go ahead and click on that.  Among the options you'll see is "New Repository" and that's what we want, so go ahead and select that.

You should now be on a new page where you will be asked to name your fabulous new repository, input a description of it if you like, and also decide things like will it be public or private.  When you have everything filled out to your satisfaction, go ahead and click "Create Repository" at the bottom of the form.

Great!  You just created you very own repository.  Now we will just need to get that cloned onto your computer.  It's not as scary as it sounds.  Get to your command line on your computer and navigate to the directory where you would like the repository to live.  Just make sure this is not already a git repository otherwise you could end up with a mess.  Grab the HTTPS clone URL from the GitHub page (should be in the frame on the right side of the screen) and paste it into the following command :>git clone [your copied and pasted URL]

That's it!  You've just cloned your repository onto your computer.

#Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the software and the code that created that software are free and available not only for people to use, but also to modify and build upon.  There are actually several different licensing schemes that fall under the heading of open source, each granting or restricting certain areas of rights.

#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I have been a huge fan of open source for a while now.  I use OpenOffice, GIMP, Blender, and Firefox, all of which are open source projects, although some of them have different licenses.

#Assess the importance of using licenses.

Under US law any work you create automatically is copywritten to you.  You could decide to simply toss your work into the public domain, but then anyone could come along take credit for your work, sell it, or whatever they wanted and you'd have no rights.  

The better alternative is to chose an open license which allows you to retain credit for the work you've done and it allows you to decide to a certain extent how others may use it and or profit from it.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Repetition certainly helps to cement the process of using github, creating repos, cloning them, and the like.  I almost feel like I am missing something, because it didn't turn out to be as complicated as I thought it would be to use.  I am curious what sort of snafus come up if you accidentally clone a repo into an existing one on your computer, but not eager enough to intentionally try it.

#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

In this particular case I found the materials provided to be sufficient, so I didn't go looking for other answers or clarifications.
