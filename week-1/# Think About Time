# Think About Time

The top three things that stood out to me from among the selections were the power of meditation, habits and the growth mindset, and the pomodoro technique, which is substantially similar to me to the concept of timeboxing.  Timeboxing will work very well with my current schedule and intersecting responsibilities by allowing me to really make effective us of the smaller parcels of time during my day.  That in turn dovetails into the ideas presented in "Habits and Growth Mindset"; it is okay to break larger problems into small chunks - even micro chunks.

 

Currently I tend to be a day or weekly planner.  I set aside some time and create a task list.  Usually the first pass is very general categories of things, but I often go through a second or third iteration where I break things down into very small, easy to accomplish chunks.  For example, I might start with an item on my task list that says "Do laundry".  Later on in the day I'll break that down into its components and create a list like this: "Sort clothes"; "Clean clothes"; "Fold and put away clothes".  By breaking a task down into its smaller parts I find it easier to make progress, and it also gives me positive feedback during the day by allowing me to feel some sense of productivity even while I am in the midst of the process itself.  Which is to say, this strategy works fairly well for me.

Taking the time for self-care and meditation I think will be very important in keeping me mentally sharp and eager for the challenges that await at DBC.  Timeboxing will also be useful (or the pomodoro technique) in arbitrarily breaking up some of my longer efforts and help to create space for me to regroup and assess how I am doing and how I am feeling about the work.

I plan to continue to use my task lists as well as integrate timeboxing and mindfulness/meditation as I plan my study schedule throughout Phase 0.
