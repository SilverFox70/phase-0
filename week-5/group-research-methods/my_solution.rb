=begin
For the first method my_array_finding_method(source, thing_to_find),
I used .each to iterate over the words in the array 'source'.
For each string 'word' in 'source', I had to use .to_s to make 'word' into a string
since the types of the words in source are not determined. Once 'word' is a string, then
we can apply the string method .split(//), which takes the string and returns an array whose 
elements are the letter of the string. Finally, I apply the array-method .include?('thing_to_find')
to determine if 'thing_to_find' is an element of the array.
After checking each word, we returned the array 'result'.
For the second method my_hash_finding_method(source, thing_to_find),
I used .each to iterate over the pairs {key, value} in the hash 'source'.
For each value, I checked if 'value' equaled 'thing_to_find'.
If true, then I pushed 'key' onto the array 'result.
After checking each value, we returned the array 'result'.

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#I used a is.a? Integer to determine whether or not one of the variables in my array was an integer before I added the increase into it. 
#I used .each for the hash method because each key/value pair had an integer for the age. I made it destructive by calling on the key within the hash each time and changing the actual value.
